# Build Your Own Payment Integration with Adyen

### Prerequisites

_Note: For this workshop we're asking you to start from a clean merchant account. The facilitators will provide you with one at the start of the workshop._

You will need a few things to get started:

* an IDE (like IntelliJ or VsCode)
* A Java SDK. You can use any but the project was tested with Java 17.
* Access to an [Adyen Test Account](https://www.adyen.com/signup).

## Introduction

This repository is a step-by-step guide to building your own payment integration with Adyen. We will start with an Adyen.Web Drop-in/Components integration.


### Context of the code repository.

In this workshop, we are using Java and Spring Boot, together with a static (javascript) frontend based on a `thymeleaf` template.
We use those because we want to reduce the amount of prerequisite knowledge (like a frontend framework) and use a Java library.

_Note: In case the static frontend environment is not to your liking, feel free to implement your own frontend solution using the framework of your choice._

In this workshop we are not asking you to build a complete integration, but rather to fill in the voids based on resources you can find in our docs and other online resources.

### Project Structure
The project structure follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure.

* The java code is to be found in `src/main/java/com/adyen/checkout`
  * `/controllers`-folder contains your main endpoint, for the context of the workshop, let's write the business-logic here instead of in a `service`-class.
  * `/models`-folder contains your objects that just holds data (data-transfer-objects, DTOs in short).
  * `/services`-folder contains a `CartService` which can store your items (sunglasses, headphones) in your basket, use the `getTotalAmount()` to retrieve the actual amount in your payment request.
  * `/web`-folder contains the controllers that show the pages (views)
  * The code you need to update is in the `/controllers` folder. `ApiController.java` for API related code and `WebhookApiController` for webhook related code.
  * You can ignore `CartApiController.java` as it only contains the functionality to add/remove headphones/sunglasses from your basket.
  * You can add your environment variables (`ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`, `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`) via the `ApplicationProperty.java` class.
* The frontend templates are to be found in `src/main/resources/templates` and the static resources in `src/main/resources/static`
  * The code you need to update is in the `src/main/resources/static/adyenWebImplementation.js` and `src/main/resources/templates/layout.html`
* Some additional information: 
  * We have decided to manage the results of the operation in the frontend `adyenImplementation.js` file, in the `handleServerResponse` as a switch statement. It could have been done differently but this means you don't have to manage it yourself.
  * The `clientKey` in `adyenWebImplementation.js` is automatically passed from the backend to the client side and can be accessed using: `clientKey`.
  * The `totalAmount` in `adyenWebImplementation.js` is also automatically passed from the backend to the client side and can be accessed using: `totalAmount`.
  * In order to play around with multiple payment methods, a `type` value is passed from the client to the server, which contains the name of an adyen payment method and that the adyen web components will recognize. You will not need to change anything here, but we are mentioning it to avoid any confusion :).
* To run the project
  * `./gradlew build` will build the project (you can use this to test the code compiles).
  * `./gradlew bootRun` will start the server on port 8080.
  * To run the project from your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ), go to `src/main/java/com/adyen/checkout/OnlinePaymentsApplication.java` -> Right-click and click `Debug` or `Run`.




# Workshop: Accepting Online payments using the `/payments` and `/payments/details` endpoints

### Briefing

You're working as a full-stack developer for an E-Commerce company that sells headphones and sunglasses in the Netherlands.
In fact, they sell the best headphones and sunglasses at 50.00 each and you're extremely excited to take on this challenge.
You're not afraid of Java, and you can code JavaScript in your dreams. You've been tasked to implement credit card, iDeal and Klarna payments using Adyen.


### Learn

In this workshop, you'll learn how to:
1. Retrieve a list of available payment methods using `paymentMethods`
2. Make a payment using `/payments`, `/payments/details`
3. Handle the 3D Secure
4. Present the payment results to the user


### Steps

The following steps can be found in a check-list here: https://wkf.ms/3QvcJe5 - The steps below additionally clarifies where to find the resources related the workshop.

0. Build the project to see if everything works.
     * `./gradlew build` will build the project (you can use this to test the code compiles).
     * `./gradlew bootRun` will start the server on port 8080.
     * To run the project from your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ), go to `src/main/java/com/adyen/checkout/OnlinePaymentsApplication.java` -> Right-click and click `Debug` or `Run`.

1. Install the [Java library](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-java-api-library) by modifying the `build.gradle` file.

```
	implementation 'com.adyen:adyen-java-api-library:25.1.0'
```

**Note:** For simplicity' sake, we've already included the library for you. You'll find the dependency in the `build.gradle` file already.

2. Send a paymentMethod request to `/api/paymentMethods` get to get the available payment methods in `/controllers/ApiController`

3. Add `Adyen.Web` using the embed script and stylesheet option in `/resources/templates/layout.html`

4. Send a payment request to `/api/payments` to initialize a payment in `/controllers/ApiController`
    * Use `cartService.getTotalAmount()` to pass the `totalAmount`, you can leave the currency as `EUR` for now
    * You can set the `returnUrl` to `request.getScheme() + "://" + host + "/api/handleShopperRedirect?orderRef=YOUR_ORDER_REF")`
      * Instead `request.getScheme()`, you can also hard-code it to `http://"
      * This url handles the shopper redirect. For it to work, you'll just need to pass the correct `orderRef`
    * You can add an idempotency key for each request here as well.

5. Add 3D Secure 2 - Redirect

6. Send a `/payment/details` to finalize the payment.

7. Handle the response from the API after the redirect.


From here, you can add the following two payment methods [iDeal](
https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/ideal/web-drop-in/) and [Klarna](
https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/klarna/web-drop-in/?tab=_code_payments_code__2).
  * If you're using Components, in `/resources/templates/index.html`, you can uncomment the lines to show the iDEAL and Klarna components.


You've successfully completed this workshop if you can make a payment with Cards, iDEAL and Klarna.

For Cards, use the following Visa Test Card number, to trigger a 3DS2 flow.

```
4871 0499 9999 9910
03/30
737
```
